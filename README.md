# Private Blog Site  

This is a private blog site built using **Next.js**. The site is designed to have two separate sections:  
1. A **public blog section** where visitors can view posts.  
2. An **admin panel** for managing posts and media, accessible via a unique URL.  

The site has a **modern, responsive design** and uses additional technologies to enhance appearance and performance.  

## Features  
- **Public Blog Section**

  - Fully responsive and optimized for all devices.  

- **Admin Panel**

  - Separate from the public section, accessible via a unique URL.
